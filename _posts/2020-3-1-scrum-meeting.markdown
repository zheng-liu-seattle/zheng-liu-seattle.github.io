Scrum is very popular in my previous company Amazon, our team even hired a scrum master to do the daily scrum meeting. We have 10+ engineers at that time, so the daily scrum meeting normally takes 30 mins or so, but the things I found out that most people don’t really care what others are talking, and they have to prepare what they need to say while others are taking...

When I started to become an engineer manager at Grab, I found that I have freedom / power to kill the scrum l, yeah! Even the initially my team only have 3 engineers, I still prefer to skip the scrum meeting and ask engineer directly on what they are working on, and how can I help...

My team is mobile focus team, which means normally don’t need too many people working on the same project at the same time, even for big projects, as long as the work separates correctly, and can be able to track through jira, no one really care what others are working on.

Eventually my team becomes a distributed team across Seattle, Beijing, HCMC and Singapore, we have 3 different time zones, make the scrum meeting even more impossible.

Instead of daily scrum meeting, I decided to use Slack bot to ask everyone publish their status at the team slack channel, there is a reminder from slack bot to ask everyone to update their status, which includes what did you work on yesterday and what are you working on today, so everyone can check others’ status at slack channel, if they are interested at someone’s update, they can ping them directly. And also everyone know each other’s status if they want to know, everything is documented at slack channel.

I believe the scrum meeting is useful or needed based on project, not team, and also depends on the complexity of the project.
